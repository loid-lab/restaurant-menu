# Restaurant Menu API

This is a **Go-based backend API** for a local restaurant. It's designed to be a RESTful service to handle everything from menu management to customer orders and payments.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Go**
- **PostgreSQL** (with Neon as a provider)
- **JWT Auth** for secure authentication
- **Cloudinary** for image management (e.g., menu item photos)

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **User Authentication**: Signup, login, and JWT-based authentication.
- 👥 **Role-Based Access Control**:
    - **User**: Can browse the menu, place orders, and view their history.
    - **Staff**: All user permissions, plus can manage menu items.
    - **Admin**: All staff permissions, plus can manage users and access sales reports.
-  меню **Menu Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for menu items, restricted to staff and admins.
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart for users to add items before checkout.
- 📦 **Order Management**: Track orders from placement to completion.
- 💳 **Payment Processing**: Integration with a payment provider to handle transactions.

- 📊 **Sales Reporting**: Endpoints for admins to view sales statistics.

## 📌 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/loid-lab/restaurant-menu-git>
cd restaurant-menu
```

### 2. Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You'll need to add your specific credentials.

```env
# Neon Database URL
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname"

# JWT Secret
SECRET="your-super-secret-key"

# SMTP Credentials (for sending emails like invoices)
SMTP_HOST="smtp.example.com"
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER="your-email@example.com"
SMTP_PASS="your-email-password"

# Cloudinary Credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 4. Run the Application

#### Directly
```bash
go run main.go
```

#### With Docker Compose
This setup is configured to work with a remote database like Neon. Just ensure your `.env` file is populated with the `DATABASE_URL`.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## 🔐 Authentication

- `POST /auth/signup` — Register a new user.
- `POST /auth/login` — Log in to receive a JWT.
- Authenticated routes require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- Admin and Staff routes are protected by middleware that checks the user's role.
